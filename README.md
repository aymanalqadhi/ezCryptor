# ezCryptor
An Extensible File Encryption Program Written in C# 

### Usage:
First, you start with 2 tabs, one for encryption, and the other for decryption.
Before doing anything, select your desired algorithm, key size, and chunk size (padding selection is not supported yet).
Then, in either tab of the main tabs (yes, you can add more tabs) you have to select files to operate on. then you press the start button :D
